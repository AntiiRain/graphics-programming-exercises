# graphics-programming-exercises

Personal exercise about graphics. Base on Graphics And Mixed Environment Symposium and UCSB curriculum and project. 

## Install
You can get each project's code in their files. But I'm sorry that you can't run them directly, you need to prepare their own environments. Please read Usage bellow.

## Usage

Because exercises for different projects are based on their respective virtual environments, separate configuration of the corresponding environment is required for each. You can find instructions on how to configure the environment in each directory.
